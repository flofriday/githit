# githit
Find trending git repositories.

This is in an very early stage, so don't expect anything.

## Run the script
1) Install golang
2) Run the following:
```
go build
TWITTER_API_KEY=XXXX \
TWITTER_API_SECRET=XXXX \
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=XXXX \
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=XXXX \
./githit
```
Of course you have to replace the tokens with the ones twitter provided you.
